KDEpy
=====

Example
-------

The package works roughly like this.
Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from KDEpy import KDE
   kde = KDE()


.. code-block:: ipython

   >>> print('test')


.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from KDEpy import KDE
   kde = KDE()



Here's some code::

   >>> print('test')
   test
   >>> 2 + 2
   3


Doctest example:

.. doctest::

   >>> 2 + 2
   4


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
